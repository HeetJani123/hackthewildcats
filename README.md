# What is the Tragedy of the Commons?
The tragedy of the commons is a concept in economics and political science that describes a situation where a shared resource is overused or depleted because individuals act in their own self-interest rather than considering the common good. This can lead to a depletion of the resource, which can have negative consequences for the community as a whole.

This is an implementation of the tragedy of the commons in Python using Ursina, a 3d game engine, to illsutrate the depletion of natural resources. When initialised, rabbits will spawn, and mantain a constant birth rate. To pause at any time, press space. Time will pass at a rate of 42 days a second. In this time, rabbits can give birth, and die of natural causes/old age.

To introduce a predator, press 'p'. One predator will be nourished enough to survive until it dies of old age (or if it goes too far from the enviornment) but the more and more predators there are, the more strain. Expirement with this by pressing p multiple times.

I've compiled this for both Windows and Mac (Apple Silicion). Check the releases tab.
